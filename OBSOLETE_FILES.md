# Obsolete Files

The following files are no longer used by the application following the UI restructure (v1.05.00.35) and can be safely deleted to keep the codebase clean.

## UI Components
*   **`components/editor/ChecklistWidget.tsx`**
    *   *Reason*: The compliance checklist logic has been integrated directly into `InvoiceEditor.tsx` as a minimalist status bar to reduce visual clutter.

## Artifacts & Documentation
*   **`IMPORTACAO_MODELO_INDUSTRIA SCUD.csv`**
    *   *Reason*: Sample artifact file from development, not part of the source code.
